  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    Personally I am addicted to technical courses, whenever I finish one there are dozens of more interesting ones waiting in the queue. As Steve Jobs said "there is always one more thing to learn". But, when I am not working or taking new courses, I enjoy vacationing with my family and friends. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus is applying data science to business. 
    I create value for my projects by understanding the financial
    cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
    I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
